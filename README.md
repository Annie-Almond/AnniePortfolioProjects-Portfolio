 HTML-CSS Portfolio :wave:
Title: Welcome to Annie Almond's - Web Projects - 2023 Full Stack Bootcamp This project highlights the first part of my web programming training using HTML & CSS to express myself through a short profile.
Description:
I have highlighted my Beekeeping hobby as the topic for a few of my projects. I currently have 4 Bee-Hives in my backyard and prefer to use my own photography to tell a story about living with Bees. To prepare the portfolio wireframe I sketched out on paper the connections I wanted to include. My portfolio highlights my experience with Techlahoma training. We meet at the Verge each Saturday for live classes where we can all work together and finish a project together. I chose to focus on HTML & CSS specifically as we are still learning in the JavaScript sections of our course-work and I wanted to put a portfolio into action should anyone with an Internship take a look they could get an introduction to my style. I look forward to creating my React js portfolio and will keep this portfolio as a separate project.
